                    <p align="left">Bullying and harassment can have a serious impact on a person's mental and emotional well-being. If you are experiencing bullying or harassment, it is important to reach out for help. Here are a few steps you can take:
                        <ol style="font-size:14px">
                               <li align="left">Tell someone you trust: Talk to a friend, family member, or teacher about what is happening. They can provide support and help you come up with a plan of action.</li>
                                <br>
                               <li align="left">Document the behavior: Keep a record of the bullying or harassment, including the date, time, and what was said or done. This can be helpful if you need to report the behavior to someone in authority.</li>
                               <br>
                               <li align="left">Report the behavior: If the bullying or harassment is happening at school, report it to a teacher, counselor, or administrator. If it is happening in the workplace, report it to a supervisor or human resources representative. If it is happening online, report it to the website or social media platform.</li>
                               <br>
                               <li align="left">Get professional help: If the bullying or harassment is affecting your mental or emotional well-being, consider speaking with a therapist or counselor. They can help you process your feelings and develop coping strategies.</li>
                               <br>
                               <li align="left">Take care of yourself: It is important to take care of yourself during this difficult time. Make sure to get enough sleep, eat well, and engage in activities that you enjoy. Surround yourself with supportive people and try to maintain a positive attitude.</li>
                            </ol>

                    <p align="left">It's essential to know that you are not alone, and there are people and resources available to help you. Remember that it is never your fault, and you do not deserve to be bullied or harassed.
